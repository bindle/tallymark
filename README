Trend Sonar
===========

   Trend Sonar is an aggregated time-based counter. It allows multiple
   disparate systems to collectively tally information, share basic thresholds,
   query the tally of a specific value, or query if a specific value has
   reached a threshold. To tally information, a client sends Trend Sonar
   a message requesting the daemon to increment the counter for a piece of
   data identified by a numeric service ID, numeric field ID, and a unique
   hash of the value to be counted.
